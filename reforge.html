            <p>Guns are made of (at least) metal, surely this metal can be taken and reforged into something else, right?</p>
            <p>As part of our Innovation & Research project in Engineering School, me and 4 other people have decided to research the existing practices of gun recycling, as well as any upcoming methods that could be used to improve existing techniques.</p>
            <h1 id="header1">What we found so far</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./sources/savedrecs.html#1">Recycling of titanium alloys in plasma furnace</a></li>
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Smelting Titanium is hard to do as it reacts to the insides of the furnace as well as Hydrogen and Nitrogen</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Using a plasma furnace is a good way to recycle titanium alloys as it can reach temperatures of 15,000°C, however it is very pricy both in money and energy!</li>
                </ul>
                <li><a href="./sources/savedrecs.html#3">Recycling of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Composites</a></li>
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Three main current recycling procedures: mechanical, thermal, chemical</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Future methods of reinforced composites could lie in green tech such as solvolysis, which could make recycling more durable and financially viable.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2307187724001007">Friction stir consolidation for recycling AA6061 chips with its metal flow investigation for billet production</a></li>
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Friction stir consolidation, or using a spinning tool that generates heat and pressure that melds chips together in a cylindrical mold</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Chips created during manufacturing could be reused and transformed into something else!</li>
                </ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/9/3/43">Recent Advancements in Material Waste Recycling: Conventional, Direct Conversion, and Additive Manufacturing Techniques</a></li>
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Conventional recycling methods are still the most used, but they are not the most efficient</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Direct conversion methods are more efficient but are still in the experimental phase</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:2em">Additive manufacturing techniques are the most promising, as they can create new materials from waste</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="header2">Help?</h1>
            <p>We planned to gather info in places around us, however, in France, gun ownership is something that is VERY regulated and as such not much info can be gathered from just going to local armories or the nearby police station. At most we'll be redirected to the ministry of defense and at least we'll get weird looks and written on a list.</p>
            <p>That's where you can help! If you're reading this, you're probably residing somewhere in America where gun ownership is alarmingly normal. If you have any information that you think can help us in our studies of gun recycling, please reach out to me! <a href="..#my-accounts">You can find my contact infos here.</a></p>
